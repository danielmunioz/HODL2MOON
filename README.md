**An AI-powered Sentiment indicator for "meme" and crypto online communities.**

Containing several models finetunned with data primarily extracted from reddit, aimed to better recognize common words used by modern "meme" traders and communities for improved predictions.

All the models contain a backbone based on the DistilBert Architecture, pre-trained using a masked language modeling objective on a collection of crypto-oriented data extracted from the aforementioned social network, then a multi layer perceptron (MLP) head is used to further finetune the models on various sentiment analysis datasets (such as "financial phrasebank", "Stanford Sentiment Treebank", etc.). 
Currently supporting __sentiment classification__ (meassuring by classes e.g. either negative or positive) and __sentiment regression__ (mesuring from 0: _negative_, all the way up to 1: _positive_).
